# Chatbot with Tkinter GUI

This repository hosts a **Python-based chatbot** featuring a clean and intuitive **Tkinter GUI**. The chatbot is designed to learn and grow over time by **storing new information provided by users in a JSON file**. It intelligently responds to user queries using **plain text pattern matching**.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Built using Tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
- **Learning Capability**: The chatbot can learn new information from users and store it permanently in a JSON file.
- **Pattern Matching**: Responds to user queries intelligently using simple text pattern matching.
- **Persistent Memory**: All learned data is saved to ensure continuity between sessions.
